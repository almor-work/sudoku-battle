# Sudoku battle

Multiple tabs play competitive sudoku, meaning one current game at all.

Everyone has the right to put in a free cell.

Whoever puts the last number first and the Sudoku is calculated correctly wins.

Any number placed on the field must be displayed on others without the possibility of change.
